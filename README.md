## AAC Internship


# 9/5/23
On the first day, the students were tasked with learning what an AAC device is and to come up with a low-tech AAC device.

* researched what an AAC device is.
* came up with a basic idea of an AAC device: 
    + it was a single button AAC sound button in which you could record the sound byte you wanted. 
    + It also had a removable picture disk that indicated what the sound byte stored is. For example, if the user stored the recording "water" on    it,       they could place the picture of a glass of water in it to indicate that.
* made a presentation on it.

On the second day, we were asked to present our ideas.

* presented the idea of the AAC device I came up with to the CEO of Evocube Technologies, Tom sir of Fablab and my fellow students.
* got valuable feedback on the idea and the presentation:
    + I was told to insert backgrounds relevant to the topic when I make PPTs.
    + was told the same product already existed in the market and was told to make it innovative. 
* after the presentation, we were tasked with making a basic design of the device in autodesk.
* downloaded Autodesk Fusion 360 and found resources to learn it from.


# 11/5/23
We were only tasked with learning Fusion 360 on this day.

* started to learn about Autodesk Fusion 360.
* the resources I found the day before were quite complicated and so could not progress much. But then a fellow student recommended [Lars Christensen](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40d7srwyc_Ow4aaOGXlP2idPGwD7ruKg) on       Youtube and I learned the basics from him.
* designed the conduit and other basic objects with his tutorial.


# 12/5/23
Today was the deadline to make the submit the design

* after the valuable pointers from the day of the presentation, I changed the design of my project.
* designed the basic model of my new product.

# 15/5/23
We had a class by the CEO about design.

* was taught the basics of a good design and was shown some of the devices the company had designed and the constraints and difficulties they had.


# 19/5/23
A meeting with a former alumni was scheduled to teach us about the basics of the electronics side of the device.

* we were given links and relevant resources to prototype our device.
* we were given valuable tips on how to go about doing that.
* [this is the main resource](https://www.instructables.com/Audio-Player-Using-Arduino-With-Micro-SD-Card/).


# 22/5/23
Got some of the relevant components.

* got a speaker and an SD Card. Have to still find an Arduino and an SD card adapter. 

# 23/5/23
* ordered an arduino from Robu.in.
* started prototyping in tinkercad.
